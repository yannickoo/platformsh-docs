# Your first project

The best way to understand a tool is to use it.  We believe that the best marketing we can offer for Platform.sh is to let you try it out, which is why we offer a free one month trial.

To begin, create a new [free trial account](https://accounts.platform.sh/platform/trial/general/setup).  You can sign up with a new user and password or login using an existing GitHub, Bitbucket, or Google account.  If you use a 3rd party login you will be able to set a password for your Platform.sh account later.

You'll be asked to select the region your website should live in.  Select the region closest to you.  (Note that Australia and the German sovereign region have a higher base monthly cost after the first month.)

After account creation, you'll be asked how to create your first project.  You can either start from one of the existing pre-made templates or provide your own.

For our featured projects and frameworks, simply select one from the list to initialize your project using that application.

You can also provide your own code, either cloned from one of our other example repositories or one that you create yourself.  The video below shows how to setup your own initial project using the Silex PHP microframework.

## Project templates

You can also initialize your project using any of the pre-made templates below.  For each one, simply Git Clone the repository from GitHub then push it to Platform.sh using the instructions for a custom repository in the UI, as seen in the video above.
