# Technical Requirements: Git and SSH

## Git

Git is the open source version control system that is utilized by
[Platform.sh](https://platform.sh/).

Any change you make to your Platform.sh project will
need to be committed via Git. You can see all the Git commit messages of an
environment in the activity feed of the web interface.

Before getting started, make sure you have it installed on your computer
to be able to interact with Platform.sh.

## SSH

One of the ways [Platform.sh](https://platform.sh/) keeps things secure
is by using SSH behind the scenes. Users connect to their Platform.sh
Git repository and to their Command Line Interface (CLI) using
SSH.

SSH requires two [RSA keys](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_%28cryptosystem%29):

* A **private key** kept secret by the user
* A **public key** stored within the Platform.sh account

These keys are called the *public-private keypair* and usually look like
random lines of characters, like this:

*A private key*:

    -----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
    MIIEowIBAAKCAQEAtpw0S4DwDVj2q04mhiIMkhvrYU7Z6hRiNbTFsqg3X7x/uYS/

    Kng4ohG6xHZ/OvC9tq7/THwAvleaxgLZN5GyXfAqNylDdZ0LtSjl
    -----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----

*A public key (one very long line)*:

    ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAADAQABAAABAQC2nDRLgPANWParTiaGIgySG+thTtnqFGI1tMWyqDdfvH+5hL91w2tK9PzaP+NJ5hA/cOyh30YRFb52Y64toU16Ko5K1mLqNFJajjWEI5Y4VukG6betrWfqdQ7XBr/s7nBuDOFQ5+eKbvug4rRSCSo8CsEI1eI0VNQkC9HJWYK28k7KurMdTN7X/Z/4vknM4/Rm2bnMk2idoORQgomeZS1p3GkG8dQs/c0j/b4H7azxnqdcCaR4ahbytX3d49BN0WwE84C+ItsnkCt1g5tVADPrab+Ywsm/FTnGY3cJKKdOAHt7Ls5lfpyyug2hNAFeiZF0MoCekjDZ2GH2xdFc7AX/ your_email_address@example.com

You will need a ssh *public/private keypair* in order to interact with
Platform.sh.
Your public key is uploaded to your Platform.sh user
account, and it then governs authentication for Git, SSH sessions (shell access),
and other tools that connect to your Platform.sh project.
