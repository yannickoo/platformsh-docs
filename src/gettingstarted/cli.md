# CLI (Command Line Interface)

## What is the CLI?

The CLI is the official tool to use and manage your Platform.sh projects directly from your terminal. Anything you can do within the Web Interface can be done with the CLI. Behinds the scenes it uses both the Git interface and our REST API.

The source code of the CLI is hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/platformsh/platformsh-cli).

Find detailed information on [setting up a local development environment](/development/local.md).

## How do I get it?

You can install the CLI easily using this command:

```bash
curl -sS https://platform.sh/cli/installer | php
```

You can find the system requirements and more information in the [installation instructions on GitHub](https://github.com/platformsh/platformsh-cli/blob/master/README.md#installation).

## Authenticate the CLI locally

The [Platform.sh CLI](https://github.com/platformsh/platformsh-cli) will
authenticate you with Platform.sh and show your projects. Just type this
command to start:

```bash
platform
```

The credentials you enter are the same as your [Platform.sh account](https://accounts.platform.sh/user).

> **note**
> If you have created your account using the OAuth Login (via Bitbucket, GitHub or Google) then in order to use the Platform CLI you
> will need to create a password, which you can do using the ['Request new password' tool](https://accounts.platform.sh/user/password)

Enter your details. A list of your projects appears, along with some
tips for getting started.

**Your command-line tools are now ready to use with Platform.sh.**

## Updating the CLI

To update the CLI at any time, run:

```bash
platform self-update
```

## What can I do with the CLI?

The CLI uses the platform API to trigger commands (*Branch, Merge...*) on your Platform.sh project.

It's also very useful when you work locally since it can simulate a local build of your codebase as if you were pushing a change to Platform.sh.

Once you have the CLI installed, run `platform list` to see all of the available commands.

You can preface any command with `help` to see more information on how to use that command.

```bash

## Installing the CLI on Windows 10

There are multiple ways to install the CLI on Windows 10. Platform.sh recommends using Bash for Windows (Windows Subsystem for Linux).

### Installing Bash for Windows

You can install Bash to use the CLI on a Windows 10, 64-bit machine. The Windows 10 Anniversary Update is needed to support Git.

To install Bash on Windows 10 Anniversary Edition you need to:

1. Activate the Developer Mode in "Update & Security" in Windows Settings. This will prompt you to restart your computer.
2. Activate the "Windows Subsystem for Linux (Beta)", under "Turn Windows features on or off" in the Programs and Features section of the Control Panel. Once again, you will need to restart your computer.
3. In the Start Menu, search for the program "bash.exe", which will prompt you to install it from the Windows Store.

Bash is now installed.

You can read more on [WindowsCentral](https://www.windowscentral.com/how-install-bash-shell-command-line-windows-10).

Upon starting Bash, you will be asked to choose a username. According to the article, it doesn't have to be the same as your current username. However, if the username don't exist, the Linux system might not be able to create the Linux directory (depending on your permissions level). It is therefore recommended you use the same username for Linux as your Windows machine (provided your Windows user name isn't "Admin", as that will not be allowed).

Once Bash for Windows is installed, you can install the Platform.sh CLI with the same command as above:

```bash
curl -sS https://platform.sh/cli/installer | php
```
